	<h5>The man from Manila</h5>
<h1 class="header">Francis Michael Durango Magalona</h1>

	<p><em><strong>Francis Michael Durango Magalona</strong></em> also known by the moniker Francis M, was a Filipino rapper, songwriter, entrepreneur & television personality. He is widely regarded as the best and the most successful local Filipino rapper of all-time. Born in Manila, he is often credited as the pioneer of Pinoy hip-hop as he was the first Filipino rapper in the Philippines to cross over into the mainstream. He became a significant influence to artists in the Pinoy hip-hop scene & the local rap community.</p>

	<li><strong>MASTER RAPPER.</strong> Francis Magalona introduced rap music to Original Pilipino Music and generally to Pinoy listeners. Before his breakthrough debut album Yo! in 1990, rap music was an alien thing in local music.
		<br>
		Kiko bravely went against convention to deliver a genre unheard of in Philippine radio. Since the time he did it, no one else followed Francis's footsteps in terms of popularity as a rapper and performer. Until the end, Francis M was the undisputed king of the local rap scene.
	</li>
	<li><strong>MUSIC.</strong> In a blog posting at the height of his battle against leukemia, Francis proudly noted how his profession as an artist allowed him to leave a lasting imprint in the hearts of everyone.

<p>For Kiko, his legacy is the music he left behind. Francis's extensive catalog include the songs "Mga Kababayan Ko," "Cold Summer Nights," "Gotta Let Cha Know," "Kaleidoscope World," "Ito Ang Gusto Ko," and "Girl Be Mine," among many others.
</p>
<p>A true artist at heart, Kiko was among the few who could easily reinvent without alienating his audience. Francis's music easily transcends genres, trends, and specific listeners—hallmarks of tunes sure to become classics.</p></li>
<li><strong>PATRIOTISM.</strong> Way before Bamboo was singing "Hoy, Pinoy ako!" Francis M was already reminding his kababayans how great it is to be a Filipino. Throughout his career, Kiko's songs were always about being proud of our roots. It wasn't always pretty though as part of Kiko's integrity as an artist included exposing all the dirt and ugliness in society.

<p>Some of his songs contain social commentary as in "Mga Praning," "Ubos Biyaya," and "Nilamon ng Sistema," among others. Outside music, Kiko coined the phrase "Three Stars and a Sun" in his clothing line—an obvious reference to our national flag.</p></li>
<li><strong>BAGETS.</strong> Before his music career as a rapper-performer, Francis was first and foremost an aspiring actor following in the footsteps of his actor parents. Kiko was part of the second batch of the legendary coming-out youth film, Bagets in 1984.
<p>He was being groomed as a matinee idol like most of his peers, namely, William Martinez, Jon Hernandez, JC Bonin and Raymond Lauchengco. Kiko's acting career, however, was sidetracked the moment he found his true calling and passion—music.</p></li>
<li><strong>FAMILY MAN.</strong> Francis was described by his children as a "cool daddy." Kiko's boyish charm was not just skin deep. For a popular celebrity with high showbiz pedigree, Kiko managed to keep his family life private. Friends described him as a devoted husband to his wife Pia Arroyo, and dedicated father to their eight children.
<p>During the time he was undergoing chemotherapy, Francis time and time again reiterated the strength and motivation he got by just thinking about his family.

<p>On <strong>March 6, 2009, at 12 noon,</strong> Magalona succumbed to multiple organ failure secondary to septic shock, secondary to pneumonia in the immunocompromised (immediate cause); acute respiratory failure secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (antecedent cause); underlying cause: Chronic myelogenous leukemia blast crisis. He had undergone several chemotherapy sessions since he was diagnosed the previous year and had been expected to undergo a bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT).</p>
<p>The tragedy of Francis Magalona's passing is that he was too young to leave the world. Like great artists who died before their time, Kiko, at age 44, still had a lot to give to the public. The loss will linger for a long time.

We are now left to look back and celebrate Francis's life, his achievements and legacy. From his music to all his other passions— photography, designing, directing—Francis embodies the boundless possibilities one can achieve.</p>
